        <h2>FALLEN ANGEL</h2>
        <p>Bete Noire is run by an organization known as The Hierarchy.[23] Lee has said that even God has no dominion over Bete Noire; it is run exclusively by The Hierarchy. The Hierarchy, in turn, typically exerts its will through the city's Magistrate. The Magistrate, a direct descendant of Cain,[15] manages the city. The position of Magistrate is passed from firstborn son to firstborn son by means of a mystical ritual performed on or after the son's eighteenth birthday.[19] The Magistrate constantly hears the voices of the city and is plagued by visions. This perception causes the Magistrate excruciating pain,[24] and he must learn to tolerate and ignore it. All Magistrates bear the mark of Cain,[25] which renders them effectively immortal and impervious to harm. Magistrates are even able to mentally control the actions of those trying to do them harm.[26] However, it appears that both former Magistrates[25] and agents of the Hierarchy[27] are able to hurt, and possibly even kill, a Magistrate. After passing the duties of Magistrate on to his firstborn son, Dr. Juris attempted to leave the city and experienced a fatal aging effect after he crossed the city limits.[25] During his tenure, a Magistrate is granted one "day off" per year, during which he is permitted to leave the city.</p>
